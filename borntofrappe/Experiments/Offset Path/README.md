# Offset Path

The idea is to use CSS properties to move the icon designed in `rocket.svg` from side to side.

- use CSS animations and `offset-path` properties to follow the path designated by a curve. See the **CSS animation folder**

- incorporate the change in `offset-distance` using the intersection observer API, and making sure there is a fallback for unsupported browsers.
