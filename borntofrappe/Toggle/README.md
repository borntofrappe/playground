# Toggle

Proof of concept to switch between color palettes. I am unsure regarding the best approach: should I use a button or a checkbox? Should I consider browsers not supporting custom properties?. I'll add more as I research the topic, but for the particular project, I decided to focus on the CSS transition and the SVG syntax behind the visual.
