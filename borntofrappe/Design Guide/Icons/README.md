# Icons

The SVG icons for the website are designed in VScode, and potentially optimized with inkscape and svgomg. The former to make due without a `<defs>` block and specifically clip and masks. The latter being a handy tool to reduce the size of the file.

- [ ] restructure folder structure

- [ ] write a script to optimize syntax with svgo

- [ ] design icon of a running shoe (replacement for the check mark)
