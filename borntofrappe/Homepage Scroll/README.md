# Homepage Scroll

After debating about the landing page and its purpose, I decided to accompany the navigation with at least an additional section, detailing the blog portion of the website. The idea is to have, underneath the navigation and hopefully following the navigation's animation, a section forwarding toward the actual blog, but most importantly showcasing the latest post(s).

As you click the blog icon, you scroll to the blog section.
