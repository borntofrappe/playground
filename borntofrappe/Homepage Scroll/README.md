# Homapage Scroll

After debating about the navigation and its purpose, I decided to accompany the `<nav>` element with at least one section describing the website and specifically the blog. With this project, I set out to explore this addition.

I expanded the logic behind the blog to every item in the navigation menu, but this is more as a proof of concept and to see how smooth scrolling could look like with more content on the page.

I also included an anchor link with position sticky, where supported, to go back up.

Again, these are not decisions which are set in stone. Consider this folder more as an exploration of possible design choices.
