# Navigation

Landing page for **borntofrappe**. The idea is to use SVG syntax to draw a very choreographed navigation. Icons describing the different items are wrapped in anchor link elements, to make them click-able and focus-able. The icons also include a label in a `<text>` element, which can be used for assistive technologies.
