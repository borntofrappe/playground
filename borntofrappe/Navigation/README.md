# Navigation

Landing page for **borntofrappe**. The idea is to use SVG syntax to draw a very choreographed navigation. Icons describing the different items are wrapped in anchor link elements, to make them click-able and focus-able. The icons also include a label in a `<text>` element, which can be used for assistive technologies.

## TODO

- `Icons.svelte` specifies a plain circle in the moment the input attribute doesn't match a known icon. Design a more appealing icon.

- create separate `.svg` files describing the individual icons. Easier to store and reuse.
