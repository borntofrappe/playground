# Create .png Icons

The goal is to create a PNG icon, starting with SVG syntax and using the Canvas API.

In the **res** folder you find a first version of this concept, using vanilla JS and the visual behind `borntofrappe.svg`. From this starting point, I decided to use `rocket.svg` instead, and expand the scope of the project with Svelte to fabricate the logo in different sizes and colors.
