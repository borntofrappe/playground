# Create .png Icons

The goal is to create a PNG icon, starting with SVG syntax and using the Canvas API. In the **res** folder you find a first version of this concept, using vanilla JS. From that starting point, I decided to expand the scope of the project with Svelte, so to fabricate the logo in different sizes and colors.
