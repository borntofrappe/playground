# OpenGraph Images

I've been thinking about the image ultimately shown when sharing a website on twitter or other social platforms. `og:image` seems to be the accepted label.

With this project I set out to create such an asset, beginning with SVG syntax.

- for the landing page, show the letter `B` describing the website own logo

- for the blog page, show the icon designed for the blog section. I am unsure as to whether or not to include the letter `B` as well

- for each blog post, show the same icon as the blog, but surrounded by the SVG icons describing the tags of the individual articles

The last of the three seems to be most intricate of the bunch, and I hope to build up to it building on the previous two.
