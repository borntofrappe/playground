# Navigation

Landing page for borntofrappe. The idea is to use SVG syntax to draw a very choreographed navigation. Icons describing the different items are wrapped in anchor link elements, to make them click-able and focus-able. The icons also include a label in a `<text>` element, which can be used for assistive technologies.

## Update

While providing a nice visual, displaying only the icons left a lot to be desired in terms of design. To fill in the white space, I decided to include a few particles all around the center. You can find a proof of concept in the **res** folder.

In this folder you also find an experiment with CSS animations, to introduce the navigation and most prominently the center icon.
