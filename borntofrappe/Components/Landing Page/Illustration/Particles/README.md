# Particles

A proof of concept to add a few particles behind the main navigation. I am unsure as to whether or not to incorporate the visual in the final project, but it was sure a good excuse to practice with a 2D array and a tad more SVG syntax.

Most importantly, the animation introduced in the stylesheet is just to highlight how the particles can be manipulated in different groups.
