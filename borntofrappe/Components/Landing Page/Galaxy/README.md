# Navigation

As the entry point for the borntofrappe website, I want to showcase a `nav` element with a very choreographed navigation. The idea is to show anchor links as if orbiting around the center of the screen, where an icon representing the website itself is shown. I am considering animating the entire lot, but one thing at a time.

For the animation of the central logo see the **Animation** folder. To see how the central illustration is created with SVG syntax, refer to the **Illustration** folder.
