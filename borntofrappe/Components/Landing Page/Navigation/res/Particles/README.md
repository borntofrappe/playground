# Particles

A proof of concept to add a few particles behind the main navigation. I am unsure as to whether or not to incorporate the visual in the final project, but it was sure a good excuse to practice with a 2D array and a tad more SVG syntax.

**Notice**: the animation introduced in the stylesheet is just to highlight how the particles can be manipulated in different groups.

## Remember to

- experiment with the `translate` value. Consider that a constant increase between different rounds gives a less than realistic feel, and it'd be preferable to have the distance decrease for each successive level.

- experiment with the size of the particles, with the `scale` value, but also the `size` describing the entire `<svg>` element.
