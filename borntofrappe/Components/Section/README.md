# Section

Design for the section introducing the different "planets" showcased on the landing page. This allows me to explore different layout solutions, especially `float` properties.

## Worth mentioning:

- the text of the sections is absolutely not final

- the icon included next to the anchor link elements can be a tad misleading (should it point toward the planet or always toward the right hand of the screen?). **However**, this icon is only temporary and is meant to be substituted with the icon describing the website

- there are actually multiple sections, to also consider the vertical rhythm and the binary choice of colors (eventually the sections are styled in pairs)
