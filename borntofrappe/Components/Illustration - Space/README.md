# Illustration - Space

Here I set to create an additional illustration for the landing page, on top of the one described in **Illustration - Planet**. The goal is to provide here an SVG visual in between the different sections, drawing a section of the sky and animating a series of shapes from end to end.

Similarly to the previous illustration, using the intersection observer API.
