# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] design sections component

- [x] update font choices (Hind Madurai for body)

- [x] document icons component. Important enough to warrant a separate folder

- [ ] include new `icon.js` file in the components and pages

- [ ] add illustration and sections to the landing page

- [ ] design icon and logos for the website (png, favicon...)

- [ ] write better copy

- [ ] design a pattern with SVG syntax to fill the whitespace
