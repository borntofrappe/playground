# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] add experiments folder

- [ ] Landing page. Consider updating App.svelte to tie the styling to classes instead of nth-of-type selectors. Declarative.

- [ ] Blog post header. Consider adding a heading/paragraph in the section presenting the tags (icons) for screen readers. `.screen-reader` class.

- [ ] consider adding the pattern following a media query checking the support of mask-image _or_ -webkit-mask-image. Padding/margin change. [Logic in media queries](https://css-tricks.com/logic-in-media-queries/).

- [ ] revise everything

  - [x] components

  - [x] design guide

  - [ ] experiments

  - [ ] pages

  - [ ] utils

- [ ] write copy for the different sections of the landing page

  - [ ] blog

  - [ ] codepen

  - [ ] freecodecamp

  - [ ] twitter

  - [ ] github

  - [x] almost forgot
