# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] restructure layouts to pages and components

- [ ] see icons README

- [ ] design icon and logos for the website (png, favicon...)

- [ ] write better copy

- [ ] design a pattern with SVG syntax to fill the whitespace
