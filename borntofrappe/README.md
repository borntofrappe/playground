# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] design icons for the new section:

  - [x] running

  - [x] [world](https://material.io/resources/icons/?icon=public&style=baseline)

  - [x] [tea](https://material.io/resources/icons/?icon=emoji_food_beverage&style=baseline)

  - [x] [gaming](https://material.io/resources/icons/?icon=sports_esports&style=baseline)

  - [x] [puzzle](https://material.io/resources/icons/?icon=extension&style=baseline)

- [ ] revise new icons to remove defs elements (tea, gaming) and improve syntax

- [ ] consider adjusting the icons with a transform attribute (tea, puzzle)
