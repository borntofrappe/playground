# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.
