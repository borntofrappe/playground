# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] add 4 and 0 icon

- [ ] set up 404 with svelte

- [ ] create a background for the different sections

- [ ] review icon naming convention

- [ ] write copy for the different sections of the landing page

- [ ] solve the sync-async mismatch between shiki and sapper
