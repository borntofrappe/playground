# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] add landing page/anchor links to landing page

- [ ] restructure illustration component to use declarative properties (not index, but tilt, rotation...)

- [ ] rename illustration to planet, with name, satellites and other arguments

- [ ] create a background for the different sections

- [ ] create a 404 page with an extra planet and the rocket

- [ ] review icon naming convention

- [ ] write copy for the different sections of the landing page

- [ ] solve the sync-async mismatch between shiki and sapper
