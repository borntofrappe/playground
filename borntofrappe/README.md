# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [ ] illustration-space: SVG between sections of the landing page

- [ ] blog planet: replace rocket icon with something more topical

- [ ] landing page: write copy for the different sections

- [ ] blog: write copy for the section introducing the blog. Or remove it altogether

- [ ] markdown parser: solve the sync-async mismatch between shiki and sapper
