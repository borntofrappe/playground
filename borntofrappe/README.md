# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] section/footer pattern

  - [x] formalize syntax (d attribute, viewbox)

  - [x] add to pages

  - [x] consider reducing the footer's padding

  - [x] update background size to avoid cropping the pattern

- [ ] edge/cross browser

  - [ ] rewrite path element to avoid cropping

  - [ ] repeat background on footer pseudo element (inherit doesn't seem to work)

- [ ] consider removing div:before path element/replacing with a more appealing pattern

- [ ] landing page

  - [ ] background for the different sections (pattern or path element)

  - [ ] background for galaxy (reconsider particles)

- [ ] 404 page

  - [ ] reconsider icons

  - [ ] add path elements in the top-left/bottom right corner

- [ ] write copy for the different sections of the landing page
