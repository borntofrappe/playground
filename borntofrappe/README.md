# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] footer's background: planet orbit

- [ ] header's background: a series of stars?, milky way?

- [ ] landing page background: rounded strokes? particles?

- [ ] solve the sync-async mismatch between shiki and sapper

- [ ] write copy for the landing page
