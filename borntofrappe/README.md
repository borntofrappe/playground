# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] design code snippet component (re requires update to the script reading markdown)

- [ ] markdown parser: update shiki script to match code snippet

- [ ] blog: write script producing the defs block

- [ ] landing page

  - [ ] background for the different sections (pattern or path element)

  - [ ] background for galaxy (reconsider particles)

- [ ] 404 page

  - [ ] reconsider icons

  - [ ] add path elements in the top-left/bottom right corner

- [ ] review icon naming convention

- [ ] write copy for the different sections of the landing page
