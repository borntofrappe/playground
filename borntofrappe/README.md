# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] update Design Guide/Icons (remember currentColor and default sizes)

- [x] revisit navigation component and animation

- [x] design icon for the website (png)

- [ ] write copy for the landing page

- [ ] consider decorations for the landing page
