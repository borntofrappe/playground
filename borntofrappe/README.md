# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] include new `icon.js` file in the components and pages

- [x] add illustration and sections to the landing page

- [ ] update Design Guide/Icons (remember currentColor and default sizes)

- [ ] revisit navigation component and animation

- [ ] design icon and logos for the website (png, favicon...)

- [ ] write copy for the landing page

- [ ] design a pattern with SVG syntax to fill the whitespace
