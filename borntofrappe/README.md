# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] experiment with `subgrid` in the blog page. Works on firefox only

- [x] consider updating the name of the components. footer -> home, navigation -> galaxy, breadcrumb -> map

  - [x] update only navigation, given the bespoke nature of the component

  - [x] keep footer and breadcrumb, given the more standard use case

- [ ] add animation to landing page; consider prefers-reduced motion

- [ ] create a background for the different sections

- [ ] create a 404 page with an extra planet and the rocket

- [ ] fix annoying :hover and :focus state on the footer; does not update

- [ ] review icon naming convention

- [ ] write copy for the different sections of the landing page

- [ ] solve the sync-async mismatch between shiki and sapper
