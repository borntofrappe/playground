# Borntofrappe

borntofrappe is meant to be my personal website. Using Svelte, the static site generator Sapper and deployed on Netlify.

Here, I try to ease the development/design of the website by focusing on independent features. Think of it as a branch without the emotional baggage that comes from being git-connected to the main root.

## TODOS

- [x] fix pixel imperfection with pseudo element and wavy pattern

- [x] fix circle around planet

- [ ] consider updating App.svelte to tie the styling to classes instead of nth-of-type selectors. Declarative.

- [ ] consider adding the pattern following a media query checking the support of mask-image _or_ -webkit-mask-image. Padding/margin changes. [Logic in media queries](https://css-tricks.com/logic-in-media-queries/).

- [ ] revise entire project starting from pages

- [ ] write copy for the different sections of the landing page

  - [ ] blog

  - [ ] codepen

  - [ ] freecodecamp

  - [ ] twitter

  - [ ] github

  - [x] almost forgot
