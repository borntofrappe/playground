# Landing Page

Building on the project developed in the **Navigation** folder, this is meant to be a proof of concept for the langing page.

The `<nav>` element is paired with a series of sections describing my online presence.

## Update

After the design of the page describing the different articles of the blog, see `./Blog`, I decided to include another `nav` element. This time, for site navigation. I might experiment with additional layout (position fixed, flex-direction column), but for the time being I leave the site navigation as breadcrumbs, illustrating the current page and possible icon.
