# Blog Post Typeset

Styles applied to the posts for the blog on borntofrappe. I am still undecided when it comes to the layout of the page, but I believe the palenight theme I'd like to use for code snippet provides a lead to a blue palette. This choice complements also quite nicely the chosen accent color `hsl(340, 80%, 55%)`.

## Notes

The markup considers the output produced in the **Markdown Parser** project. The only difference resides in the header, which houses the title of the post and a series of SVG icons. The idea is to fill in the header with the information retrieved from the frontmatter.

## Font

- headings: `Vesper Libre`

- body `Source Sans Pro`

- code: `Fira Code`

## Colors

- accent: `hsl(340, 80%, 55%)`

- palenight background: `hsl(229, 20%, 20%)`. This is used as a starting point

## TODOS

The choices made in the `html` and `css` files make for quite an appealing style, but I need to develop a system for the font, colors, and even sizes used in the project.

- [ ] color palette

- [ ] sizing rules
