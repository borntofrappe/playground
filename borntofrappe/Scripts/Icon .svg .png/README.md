# Icon .svg .png

This is less of a script and more of a utility. The goal is to create a PNG icon of any size, starting with SVG syntax and using the Canvas API.

In the **res** folder you find a first version of the utility, using vanilla JS. I decided to expand the scope of the project with svelte, so to fabricate the logo in different sizes more rapidly.

In terms of design, I decided to skip styling altogether, and rely instead of the default provided by the svelte template.
