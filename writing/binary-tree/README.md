# Binary Tree

Exploring the binary tree algorithm, as found in the book [Mazes for Programmers]() by [Jamis Buck](), I maged to create quite a few projects.

Hopefully, I'll find the words to describe the code of this repo.

- `binary-tree-algorithm.js`, setting up a grid of cells, each with a field detailing which side to actually draw

- `binary-tree-maze.js`, creating the necessary markup to draw the maze with SVG syntax

- `binary-tree-diagram.js`, visualizing the tree structure with the D3 library
