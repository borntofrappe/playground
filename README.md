# Playground

I'm in the process of building two websites:

- borntofrappe

- gabriele saves

Both require quite a bit of effort, and I feel I could greatly benefit from a repository like this one, where I develop features independently and with a smaller footprint. For instance and for the landing page ultimately included in **borntofrappe**, having a project dedicated to the loading animation allows me to focus on the necessary CSS property value pairs.
